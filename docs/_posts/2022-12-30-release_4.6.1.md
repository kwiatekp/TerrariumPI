![Fireworks](/assets/img/Fireworks.gif){: .right width="100" }
This is a release which fixes a lot of the new GUI issues. Apparently christmas came to early ;). But with this release, all the annoying bugs are hopefully fixed. Even when you are now running 4.6.0 without issues, it is wise to upgrade to 4.6.1. Most issues arises when you start to edit areas or hardware in the GUi.

[Get the new version here](https://github.com/theyosh/TerrariumPI/releases/tag/4.6.1).

Or, go the [installation]({% link _tabs/install.md %}) page in order to install Terrarium PI version 4.
